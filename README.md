# Sakura and the Clow Cards

### A self-designed 2D platformer game made from scratch with C and SDL3

## Overview

For learning purposes, this is a very simple and primitive 2D platformer game, made with SDL3, and maybe later on with some libraries to help with the game engine. The game revolves around a magical girl named Kinomoto Sakura, who is on a mission to recollect all of the Clow Cards. For each Clow Card she collects, she gets a new ability for platforming.
